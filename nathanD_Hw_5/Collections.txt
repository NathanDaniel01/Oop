Create a custom object (like Cord in the example) to make a set and/or map key.

Make a shared_ptr < Heirarchy > the contents of a vector. 

Vector: container thats a dynamic array - make it of any type you want and automaticly increase in size if 
you need to add any elemnts to it.
TLDR: an array but better

To Run: ./run -> go to docker container. run latest container by hitting cli. b/<File Name>
